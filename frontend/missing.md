# Missing Features and Improvements Before Deployment

After scanning the frontend codebase, here are the basic and expected features that are currently missing or incomplete:

## 1. Forgot Password / Reset Password
- No dedicated "Forgot Password" or "Reset Password" page/component.
- The login page does not provide a "Forgot Password?" link or flow for users to recover their account.

## 2. Error Pages
- No custom error pages, such as a 404 Not Found or 500 Internal Server Error page.
- Users who visit a non-existent route will not see a friendly error message.

## 3. Legal Pages
- No Terms of Service or Privacy Policy pages/components are present.
- These are important for user trust and compliance.

## 4. UI/UX Enhancements
- No confirmation modals for destructive actions (e.g., deleting a profile or resume).
- Minimal or missing feedback for network errors in some forms.

## 5. Accessibility & Responsiveness
- Some pages/components may lack accessibility improvements (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, etc.).
- Ensure all pages are fully responsive on mobile devices.

## 6. Route Integration
- If new pages are added (e.g., forgot password, error, legal), update the router to include these routes and set up a fallback for 404 pages.

## 7. Miscellaneous
- Consider adding a user settings page for changing password/email.
- Add basic test coverage for critical flows (login, signup, profile update).

**Recommendation:**
- Implement the above features for a more complete, user-friendly, and production-ready deployment.
- Prioritize password recovery, error handling, and legal compliance first.
